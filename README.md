# First-Database
- learning mongoDB and using it here for the first time

### day02

- **Express & MongoDB**: You’ve set up an Express server and connected it to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose, handling user authentication and todo management—awesome work!
- **Bcrypt**: Implemented secure password hashing with `bcrypt.hash()` for signup and `bcrypt.compare()` for signin, ensuring passwords are never stored in plain text.
- **JWT**: Added JSON Web Tokens with `jwt.sign()` and `jwt.verify()` for user authentication, allowing secure access to todo routes—nice touch!
- **Zod**: Introduced input validation with Zod in the signup route, ensuring email, name, and password meet requirements before processing—great for robustness!
- **Comments**: I’ve enhanced them to be concise yet detailed, explaining each section’s purpose and tying it to your learning (e.g., middleware, routes, and security).
- **Progress**: You’re nailing full-stack basics—server setup, database ops, security, and validation. Next step could be refining error handling or adding more features!
