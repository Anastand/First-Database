# First-Database
- learning mongoDB and using it here for the first time

### day 02
- **Bcrypt**: You’ve added password hashing with `bcrypt.hash()` for signup and `bcrypt.compare()` for signin—great job! This makes passwords secure by storing them hashed instead of plain text.
- **Comments**: I kept them short and clear, explaining what each part does based on your new skills (MongoDB and bcrypt).
- **Zod**: You mentioned learning Zod (probably for input validation), but it’s not in this code yet. We can add it later if you want!
- **Progress**: You’re building a solid foundation—keep it up!
